# About

Yitter is a free and open source alternative Twitter front-end focused on
privacy built from Nitter. The open source code for Nitter is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/zedeus/nitter>

* No JavaScript or ads
* All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Twitter
* Prevents Twitter from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
* Unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)
* Lightweight (for [@nim_lang](/nim_lang), 60KB vs 784KB from twitter.com)
* RSS feeds
* Themes
* Mobile support (responsive design)
* AGPLv3 licensed, no proprietary instances permitted

## Why use Yitter?

It's basically impossible to use Twitter without JavaScript enabled. If you try,
you're redirected to the legacy mobile version which is awful both functionally
and aesthetically. For privacy-minded folks, preventing JavaScript analytics and
potential IP-based tracking is important, but apart from using the legacy mobile
version and a VPN, it's impossible.

In addition to respecting your privacy, Yitter is on average around 15 times lighter than
Twitter, and in some cases serves pages faster.

In the future a simple account system will be added that lets you follow Twitter
users, allowing you to have a clean chronological timeline without needing a
Twitter account.
